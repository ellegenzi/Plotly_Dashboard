    <!-- This file contains the JavaScript code that makes up the Plotly library. Such a link is called a CDN.
    CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. In short, a CDN provides links to downloadable resources, such as Plotly
    library code. An alternative to using CDNs is to download the file and use it locally, but using this particular
    CDN ensures that the most up-to-date version of Plotly is always delivered. -->
